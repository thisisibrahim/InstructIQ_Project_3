//PEFT Text Summarization//

Overview:-

PEFT Text Summarization is an efficient text summarization tool leveraging Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). This project optimizes large language models for summarization tasks while reducing computational costs. It supports both extractive and abstractive summarization methods.

Features:-

Implements PEFT for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained models.
Supports extractive and abstractive summarization.
Built using PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers.
Optimized for performance while minimizing resource consumption.
Customizable for different domains and text inputs.


For batch processing or API integration, refer to the documentation within the project.
