//PEFT Text Summarization//

Effortless and accurate text summarization using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)! This project leverages PEFT techniques to create a high-performing summarization model with minimal computational resources.

🌟 Overview
Text summarization is essential for extracting key information from large volumes of text. This project implements a summarization model using PEFT to fine-tune a pre-trained language model efficiently.

🔥 Why PEFT?
🚀 Fine-tunes pre-trained models with fewer parameters
💡 Faster training and inference
⚡️ Requires less memory and computing power
